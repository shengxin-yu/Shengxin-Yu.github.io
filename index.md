## About Me

I’m a doctoral candidate in Civil Engineering at <a href="https://www.tongji.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Tongji University</a>, working under the mentorship of <a href="https://faculty-civileng.tongji.edu.cn/fangcheng/en/index.htm" target="_blank"> Prof. Cheng Fang</a>. My master's career started in September 2021 and will last until June 2024. My research mainly involves the design, simulation, and testing of novel dampers and isolation structures with excellent seismic resilience (e.g. new configurations, new materials), but also includes the system-level seismic performance assessment of the proposed components. I have also participated in projects such as structural health monitoring for civil engineering using computer vision based on deep learning, machine learning-assisted calculation and optimization, etc.

Since entering the master's program, I have won the <a href="https://civileng.tongji.edu.cn/fb/8b/c17998a326539/page.htm" target="_blank"> National Scholarship for Postgraduate Students</a> and the honorary title of Outstanding Student of Tongji University. I was first involved in research on applying deep learning-based computer vision techniques to structural health monitoring. From the autumn of 2022, I started to take charge of the project of new seismic isolation structures, where I explored and continued my research interest in novel structures with seismic resilience. At present, I have accumulated some research findings. But I feel that the most important thing is that my scientific research, communication, goal planning and problem-solving skills have been greatly improved, and I believe that I can be qualified for many civil engineering-related doctoral project.

In addition, before joining the master's program, I obtained a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from <a href="https://www.dlut.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Dalian University of Technology</a>. During this period, I received many honors and awards, such as the honorary title of outstanding graduates of Liaoning Province and a large scholarship (only two people in the entire department received it), twice the title of the school's top three students, multiple single-category scholarships, etc.

In my life, I am a sunny, strong-minded, and optimistic person. I like traveling, climbing, and playing badminton. I have family and friends who love me and whom I love. I believe no pain no gain, I will continue to work hard!
